# Quarantine Days of Code.

## What is in this repo ?
Code projects for idle time during the COVID-19 self isolation. 

## Why?
To keep productive and build fun stuff but in a more structured way

## What projects?
Some ideas: 
1. [Python based screen recorder, record screen and then maybe use this in automation setting - WIP!](Screen-recorder)
2. Pygame based curve fever, simple and classic version! Maybe integrate some fun AI snakes. 
3. COVID data fetcher with continuous plotting and summary of important content from across the world. 
4. Privacy invader: Take screenshots of your desktop at random intervals and maintain a journal of your digital activity. 
5. Still thinking of more ideas. Idea generator maybe? Startup idea generator ?
6. Hack instagram and make some nice visualizations?
